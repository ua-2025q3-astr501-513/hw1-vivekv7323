# ASTR 513 Homework Set #1
#
# Part 1.
#
# This "pyproject.toml" file is used by python to configure a package.
# The minimal required fields are `name` and `version`.
# For this homework, because we use `pytest` to auotmatically grade
# the homework, we should also include `dependencies` to list at least
# "pytest".
#
# Your are asked to fill in details in "pyproject.toml" and add a
# "LICENSE" file to this repository.
# This turns your homework set into a pip-installable python package.
#
# You may test your work by running `pip install -e .`
