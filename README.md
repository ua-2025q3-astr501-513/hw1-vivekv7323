# ASTR 513 Homework Set #1

Welcome to the repository for **Homework Set #1** in ASTR 513.
This homework set is worth **5 points** and is designed to test your
understanding of topics that we covered in the first three classes.
The submission cutoff time is at **Wednesday Sep 10th, 11:59pm**
Arizona time.
Use this GitHub Classroom Link:
https://classroom.github.com/a/r-eqz-mO
to accept it.


## Structure and Grading

This homework set consists of **five parts**, each contributing
equally to your overall grade.

* Each part will be graded using `pytest`, an automated testing
  framework.
* The correctness and the documentations/comments of your solutions
  accounts for 1 point per part (5 points in total).
* You can run `pytest` in GitHub Codespaces or your local development
  environment to verify your solutions before submission.

By following the interface and prototypes provided in each of the
templates, you can ensure compatibility with the autograding system
and maximize your score.


## Parts

### Part 1: Setup Python Package (1 point)

* Objective:
  Learn how to set up and organize a pip-installable python package.
* Details:
  * Fill in details in "pyproject.toml" and add a "LICENSE" file to
    this repository.
    This turns your homework set into a pip-installable python
    package.
  * Properly organize source code, tests, and documentations.

### Part 2: Integer Negation and Subtraction Using NAND Gates (1 point)

* Objective:
  Implement a function that performs integer negation using only NAND
  gates and use it to implement subtraction.
* Details:
  The description of the problem and the solution template can be
  found in `hw1/p2.py`.

### Part 3: Implement a Numerically Stable Quadratic Equation Solver (1 point)

* Objective:
  Implement a numerically stable quadratic equation solver that does
  not catastrophic cancellation.
* Details:
  The description of the problem and the solution template can be
  found in `hw1/p3.py`.

### Part 4: Solve the Coupled Simple Harmonic Oscillator Problem (1 point)

* Objective:
  Implement an eigenvalue solver to decompose coupled simple harmonic
  sscillators into eigenmodes, and solve it semi-analytically.
* Details:
  The description of the problem and the solution template can be
  found in `hw1/p4.py`.

### Part 5: Providing Project Ideas (1 point)

* Objective:
  Provide draft project ideas in order to form teams.
* Details:
  * This part ensures student start putting time to brainstorm their
    (mid-term) projects.
  * Your submission should include three project ideas based on the
    topics that are covered in the first half of this course:
    * Data Representation and Errors
    * Numerical Linear Algebra
    * Fourier Transform and Spectral Analysis
    * Interpolation and Extrapolation
    * Numerical and Automatic Derivatives
    * Numerical Integration of Functions
    * Root Finding and Optimization Methods
    * ODE Integrators
    * PDE Solvers
  * You submission will be a well formatted YAML file `hw1/p5.yaml`.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a new repostiory based on this template by using the
   provided GitHub Classroom Link and work on the different parts
   locally on your computer or in GitHub Codespaces.
2. Use `pytest` to test your solutions before submission.
   Ensure that all tests pass to maximize your automated evaluation
   score.
3. **Submit your completed homework set by pushing your changes to the
   repository before the deadline.**

**Note**:
**The submission deadline is a strict cutoff.
No submission will be accepted after the deadline.**
Manage your time effectively and plan ahead to ensure your work is
submitted on time.
Frequent and incremental `git commit` and `git push` are recommended
to ensure your latest work are seen.


## Additional Notes

* Collaboration:
  You are encouraged to discuss ideas with your peers, but your
  submission must reflect your own work and understanding.
* AI:
  When using AI, you must follow the course policy.
  The bottomline is that you may use AI as a collaborator to help you
  learn, but the code must reflect your own work and understanding.
* Help and Resources:
  If you encounter any difficulties, please refer to the course
  materials, consult your instructor, or seek help during office
  hours.
* Deadlines:
  Be mindful of the submission deadline, as late submissions will not
  be accepted.

Good luck!
