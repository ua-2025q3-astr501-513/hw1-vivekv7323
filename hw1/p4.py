# Part 4: Solve the Coupled Simple Harmonic Oscillator Problem (1 point)
#
# * Objective:
#   Take the coupled harmonic oscillator problem we solved in class
#   and rewrite it using a well-structured Python class.
# * Details:
#   The description of the problem and the solution template can be
#   found in `hw1/p4.py`.
#
# From lecture `02w`, we solve systems of coupled harmonic oscillators
# semi-analytically by numerically solving eigenvalue problems.
# However, the code structure was not very clean, making the code hard
# to reuse.
# Although numerical analysis in general does not require
# object-oriented programming, it is sometime useful to package
# stateful caluation into classes.
# For this assignment, we will provide a template class.
# Your responsibility to implement the methods in the class.
